## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? 
A version Control System

2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
Git is a Version Control System used to save and store our many versions of code while working on a project. Github is an online resource and company. You can manage and view previous updates to Git repositories. This allows you to share code within your company. 

3. Why do we create a branch? 
We create additional branches to separate our code and work from the main branch. This allows us to work without interfering with code and allows us to push and send pull requests for someone to review and compare our code. 

4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
It allows us to send in our code within our branch to then be merged into the main branch/code. It's helpful when working on fixing bugs or pushing updates. You can review changes before officially pushing the code. 

5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
 git checkout main 

6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
'git fetch' tells local git to retrieve data info from the original 
'git pull' also does this and brings those changes from the remote to the local repository. brings your local branch up to date with remote.
'git merge' puts a repository's fork history back together. integrates all development into a single branch 

7. What is a merge conflict?
An event that occurs when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits

8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
open and make the needed changes
